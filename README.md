# RefAlarm
This is a special alarm clock for Android which rings the alarm after a certain time period of inactivity on your device. This was made for a friend of mine who was in urgent need of this.
Any changes in UI or the functionality of the app are welcome.
# How It Works
Suppose you set the frequency as 30 min, then when your phone's screen goes off it sets the alarm to ring after 30 min.
If you turn the screen on before 30 min the alarm will get canceled and will wait until the next time the screen goes off to trigger itself.
To turn off the alarm you just simply need to turn on the screen.
